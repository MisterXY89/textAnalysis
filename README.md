# German news text mining and analysis

Some work in progress playground for text mining and analysis techniques
applied to the German language.

Namely:
 - language/textual complexity, see Toni Amstad's dissertations (thx to u/toikpi/)

  there is a good introductory article here: https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/visualising-text-complexity-with-readability-formulas-c86474efc730
 - sentiment analysis, see Oliver Guhr
 - [TODO] summary of texts
 - [TODO] topic modeling
 - [TODO] opinion mining

## Libraries
 I'm using:
 - spacy & nltk for common NLP tasks
 - NewsPlease for fetching news articles by their url
 - pyphen for syllables interaction
 - germansentiment for the sentiment analysis

## A general link/resource collection
I'm using this mainly for me, so I have a place to save potential useful stuff :D
